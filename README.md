# TicTacToe
 
## Build & Running 
To build the project:
1. Open the `.xcodeproj` file
2. Run the application (`CMD + R`) on your chosen simluator

## Methodology & Reasoning
During the process a number of decisions were made, see below the choices that were made and the reasons why.

### Design Patterns
* The most suitable design pattern for this demo is MVC, and which is the one used. MVVM/VIPER would have been over engineering.

### Testing
* A Test-Driven approach was used to help maintain code quality.
* XCTest framework was used due to its ease of use.
* Code Coverage currently sits at 100% for the logic and 70% for the entire codebase.
